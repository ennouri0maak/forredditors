UPDATE as of 2025:

To be frankly honest, i made this project back while the pandemic days and i had 0 knowledge about python back then.
Worth noting i was 15 years old with some js+html+css programming experience.

I remember i found my self reading through selenium documentation like my life depended on this project, maybe i was karmafarming,
looking for donations, goofing around or whatever i was doing in the pandemic summer.

Looking back to this project i , now,  (18 with decent python knowledge) really do aknowledge that i programmed an anomaly, and this shit 
is not even corrigible in any ways.

To this day, I still get some dm's on reddit asking me to "fix my shit" or "i updated the driver and it is still not working" or " when will you make the video" .

Random story but i got some wild donations for that project, ppl even donated 1k dollars and so on. Unfortunately, i do believe the btc address i putted
was switched because of a computer virus i had, and i never got acces to what actually reached 0.21 btc.(i switched the address with a new one although but it still keeps me 
awake sometimes that i have potentially lost 0.21 btc, and it took sometime to get past it.) 

I once again apologize to any programmer who had the misfortune of looking through the scripts I made. Even I cringe when I look back at them; it was very childish, lol.

Anyways;

Happy new year.

Edit: there are more than 5 people that contributed to that project, thank you very much , and sorry again because you had to go through this anomaly <3.
